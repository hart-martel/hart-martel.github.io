    Lastly, i also have my own dreams and ambitions in life. I have an ambitions about being a rich person. 
    That doesn't  worry no more about financial problems. I want to be a finacially stable person. Another ambition 
    is to have a family in the future which i would love the most, ofcourse with my most beloved girl. I also want to 
    treat my mom by that time as a queen, buy her those things that she wanted as it is my way of showing her my 
    genuine love towawrds her.. i want to include my dad about in my dreams but sadly he already died.. he didn'to 
    got to see his only son graduating from college.
