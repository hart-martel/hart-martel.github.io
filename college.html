    Another year has passed easily and i have graduated already in SHS, moving into the College without even noticing, 
    I took an exam at UDM and luckily passsed the  entrance exam. This time i made sure that i will try to do my best 
    to make alot of friends, even we are still in our online classes. So far, it is going smoothly , i have made 
    friends with my classmates and for me, it is the best thing happened to me. Recently in Nov. 6, we claimed together 
    our monthly allowance. That was the first time we have i have seen them in person. It was a splendid memory for 
    me to keep. Hoping to continue this kind of bond and relationship with them for years to come.
