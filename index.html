        Hi there, my name is Rhohart Martel or you can also call me Hart. I'm passionate about learning everything, especially on 
        how the world works around me, I also enjoy spending my free time with playing online games just like a typical teenager 
        you know. I’m currently 19 years old and a student from Universidad De Manila, currently taking Bachelor of Information 
        Technology with a specialization on Data Science.<p>

        <H3>More About Me?</H3>
	 
        Well, I believe in “Learn as if you will live forever, live like you will die tomorrow”, which has helped me to be more 
        motivated towards my everyday life, fulfilling my daily goal to learn something even it is just little. When I grow up, 
        I want to be someone who has a capability to be independent, making my own money, exploring the world and live my life. <P>
    
        I know you'll be back soon,<BR>
        Rhohart Martel
