	There was a girl at the age of 18, who came all the way to  Manila to try her luck here. 
	She is the breadwinner of her family so she tried to work here, luckily she managed to get a job in a food factory. 
	In that factory, she met a handsome man at the age of nearly 40's. That is her boss! That man liked that girl and he
	tried to court her using love letters, at first, the girl does not respond to it, but later on, she has been 
	attached to that man, slowly falling inlove with each other. That girl is my Mom and that handsome man 
	is my Dad.
